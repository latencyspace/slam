# This script patches the pybind11 cast.h file to fix a specific issue with casting.
# It checks if the patch is already applied and only applies it if necessary.
# Usage: Run this script in the environment where pybind11 is installed.
# Note: This script assumes that the pybind11 library is installed in the standard location.
# It creates a backup of the original file before applying the patch.
