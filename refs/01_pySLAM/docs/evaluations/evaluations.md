# Evaluations 

The following evaluation reports compare the metrics obtained with the `baseline` preset, `ORB2` local features + `DBOW3`, against the presets `ROOT_SIFT` + `DBOW3_INDEPENDENT`, and `SUPERPOINT` + `DBOW3_INDEPENDENT`. The results have been obtained by running `./main_slam_evaluation.py` with the json configuration files contained in the subfolders `EVAL_TUM`, `EUROC` and `KITTI`, respectively. 

The data have been obtained by running the script [main_slam_evaluaption.py](../../main_slam_evaluation.py) and using the json configuration files in the folder [../../evaluation/configs/](../../evaluation/configs/).
